## Deliverables
- Use Case (use_case.md): Outlines the healthcare scenario, problem description, data sources, and workflow.
- The architecture diagram (architecture_diagram.png or Mermaid in architecture_plan.md) depicts how the frontend, computation, storage, database, and optional AI components work together.
- The Architecture Plan (architecture_plan.md) describes service mapping, data flow, security/governance, and cost concerns.
- Reflection (reflection.md): Covers confidence areas, uncertainties, alternative architectures, and next actions.

## Instructions
1. Read 'use_case.md' to better grasp the healthcare scenario.
2. Open 'architecture_plan.md' to view the detailed architecture and implementation plan. Render the Mermaid diagram if available, or view 'architecture_diagram.png'.
3. Read'reflection.md' to gain design insights and future directions.

## Notes
- The project solely uses **synthetic or pseudonymized data**; no real PHI is present.
- Costs are reduced by utilizing free/student tiers, serverless functions, and scheduled tasks.
- The prototype is optional and may need Azure resources to function properly.
