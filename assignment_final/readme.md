## Deliverables
- **Use Case (use_case.md):** Defines the healthcare scenario, problem statement, data sources, and workflow.
- **Architecture Diagram (architecture_diagram.png or Mermaid in architecture_plan.md):** Shows how frontend, compute, storage, database, and optional AI components fit together.
- **Architecture Plan (architecture_plan.md):** Explains service mapping, data flow, security/governance, and cost considerations.
- **Reflection (reflection.md):** Discusses confidence areas, uncertainties, alternative architectures, and next steps.

## Instructions
1. Review `use_case.md` to understand the healthcare scenario.
2. Open `architecture_plan.md` for the detailed architecture and implementation plan. Render the Mermaid diagram if supported, or view `architecture_diagram.png`.
3. Read `reflection.md` for design insights and future directions.

## Notes
- The project uses **synthetic or pseudonymized data** only; no real PHI is included.
- Costs are minimized by using free/student tiers, serverless functions, and scheduled jobs.
- The prototype is optional and may require Azure resources to run successfully.
